ENMA200 MATLAB Project
üìö About the Project
This repository contains my project submission for the ENMA200 MATLAB course at the University of Dubai.

The project demonstrates the use of MATLAB for solving basic engineering tasks, including GUI development, plotting graphs, processing audio signals, and finding polynomial roots.

Each task was implemented using simple and clear MATLAB code, with a focus on applying the fundamental skills learned during the course.

üõ† Project Tasks
1. Simple Calculator App (GUI)
Developed a simple calculator using MATLAB App Designer.

The App accepts two numbers and lets the user select an operation (Add, Subtract, or Multiply).

If the result is greater than 100, it displays 99 instead automatically.

2. Plotting Mathematical Functions
Plotted two functions:


g(x)=2x^2
  for 
‚àí3‚â§x‚â§3


y=sin(Œ±) for 
‚àí2œÄ‚â§Œ±‚â§2œÄ

Used the subplot command to display both plots in the same window.

3. Audio Signal Processing
Loaded MATLAB‚Äôs built-in train audio signal.

Doubled the length of the audio by concatenating the signal with itself.

Played both the original and modified audio to observe the difference.

4. Polynomial Roots
Expressed a given polynomial using its coefficients.

Calculated and displayed its roots using the roots function.
